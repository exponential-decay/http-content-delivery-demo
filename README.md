# http-content-delivery-demo
A demo of server content delivery enabling users to select HTTP response headers for themselves.

Primary purpose is to observe the effect of different HTTP response headers in various browsers after discovering quite wildly different behaviours in Internet Explorer vs. Chrome when delivering binary content 'inline'. This approximates the delivery of files from the Rosetta Long Term Preservation system v4.0.1 at least.
